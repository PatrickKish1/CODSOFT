# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP TASKS

I got the opportunity to become a python developer intern at Codsoft and before the internhip began I was given some tasks to complete to test my capabilities and passion about being a python developer. Here are the different tasks and what I did:

Note: All apps are gui and the library used was pyqt6.

### TASK 1 - To-Do App
For the first task a to-do application was to be developed. In the to-do application the first page is the login page, the application was designed to handle multiple users. A new user can sign up and after creating an account they can login. After logging in user lands on the activities page where they create their to-do activity list. The list is stored in excel and is displayed in real-time on the application, users have the option to check an activity and also delete an actvity.

### TASK 3 - Password Generator
Task 3 was a password generator. This works such that the user enters the length of the password and it generates random sequence of passwords. There is a little twist though, if the password length entered is less than 8 nothing will be generated.

### TASK 4 - ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
This is a game we all love to play, in task 4 the popular rock-paper-scissor game had to be converted to an application. In this app there are three buttons for the user which indicate rock, paper and scissor. For each option clicked the status of win or lose is returned to the user to determine who won. A game round is a total of 5 plays, at the end of 5 plays a game round is concluded and the results is displayed in a table below the game area.

### TASK 5 - Contact Book
The final task, was to create a contact book app. This in hind-sight was very similar to the to-do app. Just made some teany tiny tweaks to the to-do app and voila contact book is ready.
